                    I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
                    She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
                    She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
                    Said it was one of my friend's songs

                    Knock knock, let the devil in
                    Manevolent as I've ever been, head is spinnin'

                    And all the roads we have to walk are winding
                    And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
                    There are many things that I
                    Would like to say to you but I don't know how
